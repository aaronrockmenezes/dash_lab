DaSH Lab Assignment
-------------------
By Aaron Rock Menezes


This is a repository for the DaSH Lab Assignment. The repository contains the following folders:
DevelopmentAssignment - Contains the code for the development assignment.
FLSys - Contains the code for the Federated Learning for Systems assignment.

I've included a README.md file in each of the folders to explain the code and how to run it.

I've attempted the following tasks:
1. Development Assignment 
    Level 1, 2
2. Federated Learning for Systems Assignment
    Level 1, 2, 3
